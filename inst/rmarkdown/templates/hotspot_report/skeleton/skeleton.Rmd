## Subsection 1 {-}
You can use R chunks directly to plot graphs.

```{r, graph, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Figure caption'}
require("ggplot2")
x <- 0:100
y <- 2 * (x + rnorm(length(x), sd = 3) + 3)
ggplot(data = data.frame(x, y), 
       aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Subsection 2 {-}

# Discussion {-}

# Material and Methods {-}
You may title this section "Methods" or "Models". "Models" is not a valid title 
for PLoS ONE authors. However, PLoS ONE authors may use "Analysis" 

# Acknowledgments {-}
Do NOT remove this, even if you are not including acknowledgments

# References {-}
A reference list should be automatically created here. However it won't. Pandoc 
will place the list of references at the end of the document instead. There are 
no convenient solution for now to force Pandoc to do otherwise. The easiest way 
to get around this problem is to edit the LaTeX file created by Pandoc before 
compiling it again using the traditional LaTeX commands.
