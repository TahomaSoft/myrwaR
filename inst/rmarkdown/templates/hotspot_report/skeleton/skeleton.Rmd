# Executive Summary

The Mystic River Watershed Association conducted dry-weather monitoring in the municipalities of Somerville and Melrose on August 21, 2014. The main goal of the monitoring event was to evaluate conditions at stormwater outfalls and other sites that have not been sampled extensively in the past few years by MyRWA and other sites of interest. Water quality samples were taken in accordance with the MyRWA MA-DEP approved QAPP along with accurate notes.

Testing revealed that six of ten tested sites had E. coli values that exceeded MassDEP Water Quality Standards for Class B water bodies for swimming. The highest E. coli values were found at Ell Pond, at outfall MEL003, where E. coli levels were 6910 MPN E. coli / 100 ml, a value which exceeds the standard for boating as well.

MassDEP Water Quality Standards for Class B water bodies are 1260 E. coli / 100 ml. for boating and 235 E. coli / 100 ml for swimming.

# Water Quality Results

On August 21, 2014. MyRWA conducted a dry-weather sampling event at Alewife Brook, Ell Pond and the Malden Canal. During this sampling event, MyRWA collected ten water samples and tested them for bacteria levels to identify potential sources of contamination that could affect water quality in the surface water bodies.

Elevated E. coli levels adversely impacting water quality were observed at six of 10 sites surveyed, where measured values exceeded MassDEP Water Quality Standards for swimming safety in Class B water bodies. In addition, at one site near Ell Pond, E. coli levels exceeded the standard for safe boating as well.

# Conclusions and Action items:

Results suggest that two sites should be prioritized, and others followed up on:

1. The two sites near Ell Pond, MEL003 and MEL002 showed the highest E. coli values, exceeding or approaching the standard for boating safety. Both show elevated levels over the past several years in dry weather, indicating persistent problems. Additional testing should be done to determine the cause of this contamination.
2. Prioritize other outfalls whose values exceeded water quality standard, as per table and maps. Note that two stream samples from Malden Canal showed moderately high levels of bacteria.

# Example Code

## Example Table

This is a latex table generated by `xtable` (but actually written in an Rmd file).

```{r, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
options("xtable.comment"=FALSE)
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(n)
out <- lm(y ~ x)
xt <- xtable(summary(out)$coef, floating=FALSE)
print(xt)
```


## Example Map

```{r map, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)
map <- get_map('boston, ma', maptype='satellite')
ggmap(map, extent='device')
```
